# DataScience_Project4 - Analysis of the Corona pandemic
4th project of Data Science Nanodegree program - Capstone Project

This is the forth project of the Data Science Nanodegree program. In the Jupyter-Notebook file CapstoneProject.ipynb an analysis on data from the Corona pandemic is made. See the full story on my [blog post](https://mirods.github.io/project4.html).

1. Installations: There is no installation required. You just need Jupyter-Notebook, e.g. from an Anaconda installation. Make sure that you also have Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

2. Project Motivation: Goal was to find out ...

3. File Description: There is just one file. Just load  CapstoneProject.ipynb into your Jupyter-Notebook. Furthermore, you need the data that has been analzed. 

4. How to Interact with your project: Go through the cells and execute them.

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.: Thanks to Udacity for the great Data Science program. I really learned a lot.
