# DataScience_Project4 - Analysis of the Corona pandemic
4th project of Data Science Nanodegree program - Capstone Project

This is the fourth project of the Data Science Nanodegree program. In the Jupyter-Notebook file CapstoneProject.ipynb an analysis on data from the Corona pandemic is made. See the full story on my [blog post](https://mirods.github.io/project4.html).

1. Installations: There is no installation required. You just need Jupyter-Notebook, e.g. from an Anaconda installation. Make sure that you also have Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn and that the two used datasets (described below) are in the same folder as the CapstoneProject.ipynb file.

2. Project Motivation: Goal was to find out how the growth over the time after start of the outbreak in the different countries can be visualized and whether ratios can be found to compare the intensities of the outbreaks. Furthermore, the goal was to check whether there are specific driving forces for the exponential growths and effective measures against the disease that allow to make predictions on the further development.

3. File Description:
 * CapstoneProject.ipynb: Jupyter-Notebook which contains the complete analysis
 * time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv: Dataset with timeseries of case numbers
 * covid19countryinfo.csv: Dataset with information on different countries in which the disease spreads

4. How to Interact with your project: Go through the cells and execute them.

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.: Thanks to Udacity for the great Data Science program. I really learned a lot.
